INSCrossfadeLabel
=================

 A custom UILabel that crossfades its text when it is changed using its text property.

Originally developed for ShopNow v2. (http://www.shopnow.de)

The crossfade label is designed as a standalone component that can be easily drag'n'dropped into any existing iOS project.
